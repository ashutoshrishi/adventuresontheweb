    # The Markdown Tutorial #

    **By Ryan Hodson ( aka [Slekx](http://slekx.com) )**

    Markdown is a lightweight markup language designed to convert plain
    text into HTML. It lets you write in a human-readable format, then
    does the HTML conversion for you. Markdown was originally written by
    John Gruber in PERL, but has since been ported to many other languages.
    This tutorial will guide you through everything you need to know about
    the Markdown syntax. A detailed description of Markdown can be found at
    the [Markdown Homepage](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).
