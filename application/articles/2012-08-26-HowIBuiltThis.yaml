title: 'How I Built This Blog.'

    This is just a short brief on all the amazing technologies I used to
    develop this blog. In a way, this was a learning process for me as the
    main aim of making this blog was to learn to use these tools.
    
    The base was *Python*. I love Python. This is the first web application that
    I have completed in Python and I am really happy with the
    choice. The numberous frameworks available makes choosing the right one
    really difficult. But at the end, It really comes down to a personal choice.
    For this blog, I chose the framework 'Flask'.

    ###Flask###
    
    [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) is a lightweight *micro* framework. And that's exactly what
    I needed. It is easy to use, I write everything in python, and
    there is not much of *learning the framework*. For a minimal web
    application, intended of learning concepts, Flask was the choice.

    Flask does not do a lot for you, unlike full featured frameworks
    like *Django* and *Web2py*, but it lets you do a lot. I might have
    chosen flask because of its simplicity and the scope of my
    project, but I am sure I will not hesitate to use it in bigger
    projects in the future. After all, you never let go of a framework
    you spent so much time on.

    It really feels like you wrote a web application from scratch, and
    that is a good thing.

    ###Markdown###
    
    All my posts are written in
    [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and
    stored in plain text files instead of databases. It provides a lot
    of flexibility and rich content. I can even sync these files
    through Dropbox. It works for me, as I can incorporate them in my
    work flow. Also, I love plain files. 
    
    However, it does come with a performance loss when compared to
    databases, but for a minimal blog like this, it really does not
    show.
    The other problem I faced was accepting comments on these
    posts. They are not stored on databases, hence I could not link
    comments to a post the usual way. Instead, I started indexing
    posts slugs (URI) in a database for comments. It works.
    
    ###Twitter Bootstrap###
    
    I re-wrote the html and css for the blog to use
    [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/). And I will use
    it in every single future project. It is simply one of the most
    useful projects ever. Probably addicting.
    
    ###Google App Engine###
    
    When I started making websites, I used free hosts like
    www.t35.com. It was a mess, but I stuck with it because I could
    not afford full hosting. Developing free web applications on
    platforms such as Google App Engine has been a blessing compared
    to that.

    There is still a whole lot of work left to do. But that will
    happen eventually. I have synced this project on my [github](https://github.com/ashutoshrishi/adventuresontheweb) 
    The code might be a little messy, but I am tidying up quickly. 
    
    Now, onto a bigger project.
